Informations for building
=========================

The ProjectJSON can be build either by using Makefile and proper compiler
or by using ProjectJSON.sln file and VS 2013 (or newer).

The requirement for the compiler is simply reasonable support of C++11.
Tested compilers are: MSVC (included in VS 2013), gcc version at least
4.8.3, and clang version at least 3.4. The project may be also compiled
with any compiler with support of following list of features:
 *) r-value semantics
 *) auto deriving types of variables
 *) range-for loops
 *) noexcept operator and specifier support
 *) default and delete keywords extension
 *) final and override contextual keywords
 *) using keyword extension
 *) enum classes
 *) uniform-brace-initialization
 *) lambda expressions
 *) unrestricted unions
 *) decltype keyword
 *) trailing return type declaration
 *) std::unique_ptr
